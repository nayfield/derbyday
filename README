A simple set of scripts for my derby day party.
   This is not for real gambling.

Requires a redis server and python-redis.  Works on RHEL6 using epel
packages.  May require modifications for newer python-redis binding
  (does not use StrictRedis)

On derby day:
1. put horses and (initial) bettors into files
2. run setup
3. point browser to tote.cgi

Optionally, seedbet can be used to bet $1 on every horse.  This means
they now have odds on the tote board.

When a horse is scratched, use the 'scratch' utility to remove them.

Scratched horses will print warnings that you need to refund.
Use 'betfix' to handle that.

Everything else should be self-explanitory via the web.  This was
built for some of the kids at the party to handle the wagering. They
get to keep the 'vig' (and any rounding errors).
