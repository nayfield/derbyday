A simple set of scripts for my derby day party.

Requires a redis server.


On derby day:
1. put posting horses and (initial) bettors into files
2. run setup
3. point browser to tote.cgi

Optionally, seedbet can be used to bet $1 on every horse

When a horse is scratched, use 'scratch' to remove them.

Scratched horses will print warnings that you need to refund.
Use 'betfix' to handle that.

Everything else should be self-explanitory via the web.
